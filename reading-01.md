## Introduction

Uh...You should look at my other github account: [Ascent817](https://github.com/Ascent817)
I'm most comfortable in C#, but I know a good amount of JavaScript as well. My biggest project has been [CourseInspector](https://courseinspector.web.app). It's a course browsing system for my high school.

To see my languages, read [Languages](language-comparison.md).
