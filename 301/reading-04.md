# React and Forms

1. A controlled component has it's mutable values controlled by React State.
2. We should update the state with the response ASAP because there is less chance of data loss.
3. In the callback function, we can use `event.target.value` to retreive the data from the form input.

## The terenary operator

1. Terebary operators are useful because they are Javascript expressions, so they can be passed as arguments to functions or used to conditionally render items in React.

```js
x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
```
