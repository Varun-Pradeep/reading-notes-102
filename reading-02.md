# What is a text editor?

A text editor is simply a way to edit text files, source code, and markup documents. Windows comes pre-installed with Notepad. While you *can* edit code with such an editor, it's often much easier and more productive to work in a program that fits your needs better. Some programs go beyond just providing a place to type, and offer a full workflow, or a full environment. An example of this is Visual Studio. When using the .NET framework in Visual Studio, templates, a GUI, and an automatic build process all help you save time and get more done. Compare that to switching between multiple windows all the time just to see your most recent changes. Such a full featured editor is called an IDE, or an Integrated Development Environment. It's what you write your code in.
